Description: # CoSpecPy - SDSS Composites Made Easy
        
        This is a package written for the purpose of creating composite spectra from SDSS data releases.
        
        ## Install Instructions
        
        Install using `pip` available through:
        
        `pip install CoSpecPy`
        
        Or alternatively you can clone this GitHub repository, navigate to the directory you have just cloned and run:
        
        `python setup.py install`
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        The only feature currently implemented (Day 1) is the `DownloadHandler`
        
        For a quick example you can use
        
        ```python
        from CoSpecPy import DownloadHandler
        ```
        
        ## Download Dependencies
        
        The `DownloadHandler` requires use of either `wget` or `aria2` to download from the SDSS servers.
        
        `wget` is GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS. Information and documentation can be found here [https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). For a quick Debian/Ubuntu install try:
        
        `sudo apt-get install wget`
        
        `aria2` is a lightweight multi-protocol & multi-source command-line download utility. Information and documentation can be found here [https://aria2.github.io/](https://aria2.github.io/). For a quick Debian/Ubuntu install try:
        
        `sudo apt-get install -y aria2`
        
        ## Features Implemented
        
        Download of spectra list using either `aria2` or `wget`. `aria2` allows for easy opening of multiple connections for a much faster download.
        
        Example included with `DownloadHandler.download_example()`
        
        ## Future Features
        
        - Batch-split downloads given spectra list
        - Spectral composite making from downloads - Options for wavelength grid, normalisation range, uncertainty estimation, plotting
        - Helper functions to go from an `astropy.Table` through to composite making
        - Possible inclusion of SDSS querying to create the fetch information for speclist
        - Long-term, add external features such as redenning estimation
